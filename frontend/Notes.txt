Steps for Integrating the Backend API with the Frontend App
Need to create a react app using command: 
"npx create-react-app frontend"
cd frontend -Go into the folder and we need to do key in command: "npm start" .
React app is started in the desired port localhost:3000
we can see default app functions.
These are the Key files:
src/index.js: The entry point for your app. This file renders the root component (App.js) to the DOM.
src/App.js: The main component of your app.
public/index.html: The HTML template that gets served. It includes a <div id="root"></div>, where your React app is rendered.
If any dependencies missing, just add the dependencies
using the "npm install <package-name>"
To build for production: Run "npm run build" to create an optimized build of your app.
