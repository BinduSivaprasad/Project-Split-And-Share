Steps for Integrating the Backend API with the Frontend App
Need to create a react app using command: 
"npx create-react-app frontend"
cd frontend -Go into the folder and we need to do key in command: "npm start" .
React app is started in the desired port localhost:3000
we can see default app functions.
These are the Key files:
src/index.js: The entry point for your app. This file renders the root component (App.js) to the DOM.
src/App.js: The main component of your app.
public/index.html: The HTML template that gets served. It includes a <div id="root"></div>, where your React app is rendered.
If any dependencies missing, just add the dependencies
using the "npm install <package-name>"
To build for production: Run "npm run build" to create an optimized build of your app.
Run both front end and the back end in different terminal.
Test the backend API using postman and see if that is reflected in the ReactApp
It should display the all the users as that is the url set "http://localhost:8080/api/user/allusers"
Update/create the user list and see if its reflected in the ReactApp
